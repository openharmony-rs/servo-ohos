"""Regenerate docs/ohos-sync/patches from `git log <base>..HEAD`.

Usage: uv run docs/ohos-sync/gen_patches.py <base-ref> [head-ref]

Commit hashes are zeroed so a patch file only changes when the patch itself
(diff, message, trailers) or the upstream blobs it touches change. The
patches directory is excluded from the diff of the commit that carries it, and
so is the vendored code that `third_party/*/update.sh` regenerates.
