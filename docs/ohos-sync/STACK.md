# ohos-main patch stack

Ordered list of the patches on `ohos-main`, first patch first. Kept in sync
with `git log base/<date>..ohos-main` by `check_stack.py` (subjects must
match exactly). Per entry:

- tier per the fork policy: A = additive, B = seam in shared code,
  C = invasive;
- coverage: what proves the patch after a rebase — `CI` (host build/tests),
  `device` (the arkweb on-device suite), `manual` (only its `Validation:`
  recipe), `tooling` (self-checking scripts), `none` (docs);
- watch: upstream paths the patch depends on but does not modify. `drift.py`
  reports upstream commits touching them, so semantic drift is reviewed
  even when the patch applies cleanly. Keep the list file-level and short.

The checked-in `patches/` directory is generated from the stack by
`gen_patches.py` and verified by `check_stack.py`; never edit it by hand.
Its diff between syncs is the GitHub-viewable form of the range-diff.

Vendored third-party code under `third_party/<name>` is left out of the patch
files, which would otherwise carry megabytes of generated sources. Each
`third_party/patches/<name>/update.sh` regenerates its directory from upstream
plus the patches next to it, so after applying the stack to a fresh base, run
those scripts (they need network access). `check_stack.py` runs each with
`--check` to verify the committed copy.

## Sync log

One entry per sync, newest first. Records the upstream range and every
patch that was dropped, superseded, squashed or split, with the reason.

### 2026-10-09 (restack, base unchanged)

- base: unchanged, `base/2026-10-08` (ab7e8fb1358); pre-restack tip
  `pre-restack/2026-10-09` = c1ea354ab8c (= `sync/2026-10-08`), new tip
  `restack/2026-10-09`. Update branches with
  `git rebase --onto restack/2026-10-09 pre-restack/2026-10-09 <branch>`.
- why: the fold step run between syncs at the maintainer's request: drop the
  placeholders, fold follow-ups into the commits they complete, and reorder
  to the target order (docs/policy/CI first, additive early, invasive
  last). Stack 53 → 37; the final tree is c1ea354ab8c's apart from this
  manifest, the patch files and one runbook bullet on restacks.
- dropped (decision 3 placeholders, one sync early; `sync/2026-10-08` keeps
  them): 4 (API-21 SDK → fef77e189b8), 35 (FontFaceSet.load backport →
  a8d5fdaa915), 40 (rustls → 866d0957e4f), 48 (responsive-iframe
  expectations → f9b43a6f0b9).
- fold:
  - 1 ← 32 (stack conventions), 41 (integrity CI job), 43 and 50 (vendored
    code tooling), and the docs/ohos-sync parts of 31 and 52: all sync
    infrastructure now lives in patch 1, and no later patch touches
    docs/ohos-sync.
  - 2 ← the CONTRIBUTING.md part of 31 (it sits in text 2 adds).
  - 4 (old 5, ArkWeb backend) ← 6 (on-device render fixes, deploy.py, OHOS
    patches): the backend did not render on a device without them; their
    root-cause notes moved into the message.
  - 11 (old 12, exported symbols) ← 13 (dlopen with RTLD_LOCAL), renamed
    to say both.
  - 15 (old 17, IME) ← 18 (UpdateTextFieldStatus).
  - 30 (old 44, vendor freetype-sys) ← the freetype-sys part of 52, so the
    crate is vendored in the third_party/patches layout from the start.
  - 33 (old 37, lazy @font-face loading) ← 45 (no fonts for unloaded
    faces) and 47 (first available font of elements without text), both
    fixes of its regressions.
  - 35 (old 39, batched web font loads) ← 49 (SVG text re-rendered when a
    batch is applied); the SVG text gap remains at 33–34.
- moved: the test app (old 21) to right after the backend, so later
  features and their tests find it in the tree; servoshell (old 33, 53),
  the RanLayout marker (34), FreeType advances (42) and the two vendoring
  patches (44, 51) before the web-font series (36–39); the load-event delay
  (46, upstream-bound on its own) right after the series; the RDB backend
  (30, tier C) last.
- old → new: 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 5→4, 21→5, 7..11→6..10, 12→11, 14..16→12..14,
  17→15, 19→16, 20→17, 22..29→18..25, 33→26, 53→27, 34→28, 42→29, 44→30,
  51→31, 36→32, 37→33, 38→34, 39→35, 46→36, 30→37.
- validation: the rebase applied with no conflicts; the final tree equals
  c1ea354ab8c outside docs/ohos-sync; `cargo metadata --locked` passes at
  every commit; `./mach check --ohos -p arkweb` at 4, 11, 15 and 25,
  `./mach check --ohos` at 26–27 and `./mach check` at 26–36 pass with no
  new warnings; `./mach test-unit -p servo-fonts` 7/7 at 29 and 33;
  check_stack.py, check_integrity.py and test-tidy at the tip. WPT at the
  web-font fold targets: see the restack's hand-off.

### 2026-10-08

- base: `base/2026-08-29` (bc6153bb1bb) → `base/2026-10-08` (ab7e8fb1358);
  pre-sync tip `pre-sync/2026-10-08` = 57bef201228.
- upstream: 701 commits; stack 61 → 53: the seven `docs: record patches …`
  commits and the two `squash!` commits folded, one new patch (53).
- rebase: `git -c rerere.enabled=false rebase --signoff --empty=ask` (the
  rr-cache held 85 recorded resolutions of unknown origin).
- conflicts:
  - 2 (fork notice): `main.yml` push preset vs #48530 (intel macOS jobs
    removed); kept the fork's reduced presets.
  - 4 (API-21 SDK): upstream fef77e189b8 (#48505) moved both products to
    API 23 → placeholder, see dropped.
  - 30 (RDB storage): workspace versions 0.7.0 (#48535) with the fork's
    `default-features = false` re-added; `multiprocess` (new upstream default,
    22c646903a0) kept in servo's `default` and servoshell's `base` group,
    whose stated contract is "the default set minus the storage backend";
    arkweb stays without it (single-process). The fork's `[lints.rust]` table
    dropped: upstream added `[lints] workspace = true` (a40515c3b0f), cargo
    rejects both, and `build.rs` already emits the check-cfg. `Cargo.lock`
    regenerated from upstream's (`ohos-rdb-sys` kept at 0.1.0).
  - 33 (chrome-less): upstream #48684 replaced `Tabs` with a `List` tab bar,
    a `Stack` of XComponents and `@Entry({ useSharedStorage: true })`;
    re-applied as `if (this.showChrome)` around the toolbar and the tab list.
  - 34 (RanLayout marker): upstream's accessibility work reshaped the
    `restyle_and_build_trees` call; marker re-added unchanged.
  - 35 (FontFaceSet.load backport) → placeholder, see dropped.
  - 36, 37 (web fonts): upstream converted `Rc<Promise>` to
    `RootedPromise`/`TracedPromise` (#47935, #48333) and `icu_locid` to
    `icu_locale_core`; resolved to the upstream-bound `lazy-webfonts` code
    (460f417f242, 3a1db33e3cc), which the code files of 36–39 now match
    line for line; 37's MANIFEST.json entry re-inserted.
  - 42 (FreeType advances): upstream d15ed10a8a8 (#48455) loads glyphs
    unhinted on Android and OpenHarmony. The fast path assumed light hinting
    and would have rounded advances that upstream now leaves fractional, so it
    is gated on light-hinted loads (desktop); the unit test asserts that and
    embeds its fonts so it also runs on devices. On OpenHarmony the patch now
    only skips decoding colour bitmaps; its OHOS measurements predate #48455.
  - 46 (load event): imports only. 51 (Stylo): upstream moved the pin
    b3e6425 → 7b2f078 (+368 Stylo commits); the patch rebased with identical
    `+`/`-` lines (context only: `clone_display()` → `*get_display()`),
    re-exported, `third_party/stylo` re-vendored, `update.sh --check` ok.
- applied cleanly, did not compile or did not work (fixed in the owning
  patch):
  - 5 (arkweb): `WebView::set_throttled` removed (c974e3c7c79) → `OnPause` /
    `OnOccluded` hide the WebView, which also stops painting; `WebView::focus`
    removed (15aa067b33e) → `set_focused`, focusing one WebView unfocuses the
    others as servoshell does with windows; blur stays a logged no-op.
    Applied to every arkweb commit, so each prefix builds.
  - 17 (arkweb IME): d2abb3339dd (#48690, landed the day of the base) made
    a composition end stop inserting text; the device suite caught it (typing,
    backspace and blur failed). Commits are now sent as update + end. The same
    bug hit servoshell's OpenHarmony port → new patch 53 (meant for upstream).
  - 30: index names unique per object store (#47936) mirrored into the RDB
    schema copy; `GenericCallback::new` lost its `ProfilerChan` (#48037).
  - 49 (SVG text): `traverse_preorder_non_rooting` →
    `traverse_preorder_unrooted` (#48555).
- fold: `squash!` commits into 30 (clippy `duplicate_mod` fix) and 36 (emoji
  expectations restored), this sync's fixups into their patches, the
  `docs: record patches …` commits into this manifest. Patches 49 (old 56),
  45–47 and 52 kept separate. Every commit now passes
  `cargo metadata --locked` (5–29 had auto-merged lockfiles cargo rejected).
  Each commit this sync resolved, adapted or regenerated carries an
  `AI-assisted:` line saying what (decision 5).
- dropped (decision 3, empty placeholders, removed next sync):
  - 4 → fef77e189b8 (#48505): the OpenHarmony product packages against an
    API-23 SDK and runs on a DAYU200; compatibleSdkVersion 20 → 23 is within
    the fork's minimum-API policy.
  - 35 → a8d5fdaa915 (#47564): identical patch-id (`--cherry-mark`).
  - 40 → 866d0957e4f (#48079): applied empty, base pins rustls 0.23.45.
  - 48 → f9b43a6f0b9 (WPT sync #47639): the edited `allowed=` variants no
    longer exist; base carries the `allow=` expectations.
- new tests: `components/storage/tests/schema_parity.rs` (30; fails on the
  pre-sync RDB schema), `test_focus.py`, repaint/tap after foregrounding in
  `test_throttle.py`, `test_cookies.py` with ControllerPage cookie buttons
  (28; first automated coverage of the cookie manager, 9),
  `test_clipboard.py` (25; replaces its manual round-trip recipe: a token
  written with `writeText` is read back after a force-stop, so only the
  system pasteboard can hold it, and without READ_PASTEBOARD the read falls
  back to the empty in-process clipboard).
- expectations: 37 drops its six `generic-family-keywords-003` canvas FAILs
  (they pass on the new base, as on upstream) and the two
  `layer-font-face-override` FAILs (passed with the lazy web-font patches
  already before this sync; upstream still fails them).
- drift (`drift.py`; hits not listed are churn in the large shared files
  covered by the compile and test gates):
  - 15aa067b33e system focus, c974e3c7c79 hidden WebViews, 07777aaa24a
    WebView borrows → 5 (above). fd4d5d0e377 key events, d2abb3339dd
    composition, 53f2a80314b touch compat mouse events → 7, 17: arkweb suite
    (IME fixed, touch/scroll/select/dialog pass).
  - 47def473014 `WebView::clear_session_history` → opportunity for 28's
    `DeleteNavigateHistory`, no drift. 12beb73b689 embedder JS in CSP
    documents → 10 gains it, no change needed.
  - c0e5583323a, 7256c05b108, 7130363bbf4 cookie host/domain/date → 9
    (manual): `test_cookies.py` added and passing.
  - 3eca066448f, d0162990069 clipboard promises/events → 25:
    `test_clipboard.py` added and passing.
  - e6aacc15323, b8fd8dbf768, 1462d866b8c, 2a8c5fab976, 84b5b2563a7 storage →
    30: only #47936 needed mirroring (done, schema test added); cache storage
    is in-memory and backend independent.
  - d15ed10a8a8, b724f6f80e1, b9ed512231f, 694133bbcf5 FreeType/metrics →
    42 (above); 31e3c3501e1, 29b00233c2c FontData → 45, 47: font WPT clean.
  - 31f660d20c5 layout image loads block `load` → 46: its WPT list
    (css-flexbox, css-grid, cssom-view) plus css-images and css-text clean.
  - cc0c73e197c, Rc<Promise> conversions → 36, 37, 49 (above).
  - Stylo upgrades fdb829e98c2, baa77ece393, cb086ca56ec, 5190fc46c70,
    614cd411f84 → 51 re-vendored; pseudo-element changes upstream do not
    touch the skip (`style_resolver.rs` hunk unchanged).
  - 64c4855e7dd, df3525edc0d ArkUI → 33 (above). a4fe23d8085 CMake step,
    da4d69a8af3 cargo-ohos → packaging works.
- validation (all on the final stack unless noted): fmt, test-tidy (incl.
  cargo-deny, WPT manifest), `./mach check` and `./mach check --ohos`,
  arkweb and servo-storage in the plain, twin and RDB-only configurations
  (warning-free); host unit tests servo-storage 53/53, servo-fonts 7/7,
  arkweb 6/6; device unit tests on the DAYU200 servo-storage 53/53 (sqlite),
  64/64 (twin) and 43/43 (RDB only), one documented skip each, servo-fonts
  2/3 (upstream's `ohos::font_list::test_get_system_font_families` fails on
  this board, as before the sync). WPT, host release build, against plain
  `base/2026-10-08`: css-font-loading, css-fonts, html canvas text,
  css-cascade 1115/1115; css-flexbox, css-grid, cssom-view, css-images,
  css-text 6564 with one unexpected (`cssom-view/resizeTo-negative.html`
  TIMEOUT, same on the base); the Stylo set (css-pseudo, css-content, cssom,
  transitions, animations, nesting, lists, selectors, css-cascade,
  css-variables) 2571, only the two layer-override passes above; SVG
  reftests, responsive-iframe and webstorage as expected; IndexedDB has a
  varying set of 1–5 worker/sharedworker timeouts per full-directory run on
  both builds (19 on the stack, 13 on the base over five runs each, the same
  tests, each passing in isolation). DAYU200
  arkweb suite 33 passed / 1 xfailed (geolocation, known) on the final
  shim; before the IME fix typing, backspace and blur failed while the
  2026-09-13 shim passed them. PLR-AL00, production
  HAP with `tracing-hitrace ohos-rdb-backend`: soft-keyboard text reaches a
  page input (empty without patch 53), `--chrome=none` drops toolbar and tab
  bar, localStorage persists across a force-stop, IndexedDB accepts the same
  index name in two stores with either backend, the `RanLayout` marker
  appears in hitrace. OpenHarmony-flavor HAP packaged against an API-23 SDK
  runs on the DAYU200. `test_clipboard.py` 2/2 on the DAYU200. Patch 30's
  RDB-vs-sqlite WPT A/B on the PLR-AL00 (release HAP with
  `ohos-rdb-backend`, the `wpt-ohos` runner branch cherry-picked): 78 tests,
  1577 subtests, no subtest differs; the one test-level difference,
  `storage_local_setitem_quotaexceedederr.window.html` TIMEOUT on sqlite,
  passes on both in isolation (sqlite 8.3–9.0 s against the 10 s timeout,
  RDB 1.2–1.4 s); store proof holds on both legs. The sqlite leg leaves
  60–70 IndexedDB databases registered whose `deleteDatabase` from test
  cleanup never completes, the RDB leg 3; plain upstream on the host leaves
  66 after the same tests, so this is upstream sqlite behaviour, not a
  stack regression. Patch 42, PLR-AL00, production HAPs of the stack
  without and with it, `servoperf page --only load`, two rounds of 5 loads
  in alternating order, `Layout>::reflow` M instructions/load: chuxing
  122.8 -> 89.9 (-27%), shibashiji 101.8 -> 94.3 (-7%), biyadi and
  keai-pruned unchanged within noise; the difference is colour-emoji PNG
  decoding (`Load_SBit_Png` 40.6 -> 7.3 M/load on chuxing).
- not run: the GenUI FCP A/B for 46 after 31f660d20c5.
- open: keep 42 (its colour-bitmap skip is still worth up to 27% of layout
  on emoji-heavy pages, see validation); patch 53 and the arkweb IME fix
  should go upstream with the next IME work; `lazy-webfonts` should drop the
  `layer-font-face-override` FAILs too.

### 2026-08-29

- base: `base/2026-08-07` (79e2c7a8827) → `base/2026-08-29` (bc6153bb1bb)
- upstream: 297 commits; stack 29 → 30 (new first patch: this runbook + manifest)
- conflicts: `ports/arkweb: wire the OHOS system clipboard via ohos-pasteboard`
  (servo-crate half now upstream 5c2a3839525 / #47177, patch shrunk to the
  arkweb glue, `clipboard` feature, READ_PASTEBOARD test-app permission;
  not a full supersede since upstream declined clipboard read);
  `storage: add an OHOS RDB backend …` (Cargo.toml vs #47198/#43819,
  `ascii_serialization` → `Cow` from #47264 mirrored in the twins).
- fold: nothing to do (no fixups pending; the clipboard shrink's empty-
  placeholder rule did not trigger — the patch shrank, it did not empty)
- dropped: none
- known stale: the RDB commit's 1.91 MiB RDB-only size saving no longer
  holds (#43819 makes rusqlite unconditional in components/net); remeasure.
- hygiene items: pre-sync `Cargo.lock` had a dangling `cookie 0.18.1` in the
  arkweb entry (`--locked` broken mid-stack); duplicated proxy comment in
  `ports/arkweb/src/runtime.rs`; three squashed commits keep an old
  `Validation:`/`AI-assisted:` pair mid-body.
- drift (from `drift.py`; hits not listed had no verdict-worthy content):
  - `b780274a164` clang-19, `058c55ed4a1` cargo-ohos build env → patch 4
    (API-21) unaffected textually; the rewritten packaging path is proven
    by the servoshell OHOS release builds. `./mach package --ohos` signing
    fails in the container (hvigor 00303116) — container config, not drift.
  - `c1517a950cc` ohos keyboard support → servoshell + xcomponent-sys only,
    no code shared with the arkweb IME patches (17, 18); device IME tests
    pass.
  - `27775d1d904` queued session-history traversals → potential behaviour
    change for patches 26 (URL bar follows history) and 28 (back/forward
    Tier-1 methods); `test_urlbar.py`, `test_controller.py` pass.
  - `6ee336ce836` MouseButton(s), `1728d63f488` a11y bounds,
    `522fa371e41` webgl guard, `a40c8f29010` threadboost, `e2bcea2a0f6`
    DPR override → embedder-API surface of patches 5, 7, 14–16 changed
    shape; `./mach check --ohos -p arkweb` warning-free and the device suite
    (render, scroll, vsync) passes. No behaviour drift observed.
  - `7a27057feec` cookie/auth memory reporting → patch 9 (cookie manager)
    compiles against unchanged `cookie_storage.rs` API; its manual
    Validation was NOT run this sync (no automated coverage) — open.
  - `cb680edc199` removed prefs, `8067519db8c`/`76f48dc9e3a`/`fb04f8f1613`
    pref additions → patches 11 and 30 set prefs by field name; compile
    proves none of the removed prefs were used.
  - `723dd93c61e`/`22b7b75ba42`/`522fa371e41` feature-flag reshuffle in
    `components/servo/Cargo.toml` → resolved in patches 25 and 30.
  - `5c2a3839525` clipboard backend → patch 25 partially superseded (see
    conflicts). `7bea9ed91f2` `Cow` origins → mirrored in patch 30.
    `fb04f8f1613` disk cache → patch 30 size rationale stale (see above).
  - `b8819327242` quick_cache, `e0b630fe3e0` aws-lc-rs SRI, `27a317dd69c`
    disk-cache temporary storage → `components/net/Cargo.toml` churn with
    no storage interaction.
  - keyword scan: `cb9b0804bda`/`748bf81026f` keyCode changes and
    `f9b4d1e6094` insertLineBreak are script-side (page-visible, not port);
    `c65518f8960`/`2a5f73586c3` CookieStoreManager is the DOM layer, not
    the NWeb cookie manager; `b3ee31d291c` media ohos dummy backend,
    `eff9ff0bfa4` OHOS font fallback, `e8ffe8e88ce` image decoder trait,
    `ba14b47a9a6` arboard wayland → not on the stack's surface.
- validation: check --ohos, tidy, fmt, test-unit servo-storage 53/53,
  arkweb release build + deploy, DAYU200 arkweb suite 30 passed / 1 xfailed,
  device nextest servo-storage sqlite 53/53 and RDB 43/43 (+1 documented
  skip), clipboard round-trip with/without READ_PASTEBOARD, servoshell
  release with and without `ohos-rdb-backend`, RDB-vs-sqlite same-HAP pref
  A/B on localhost origin, and the full WPT subset A/B via
  `./mach test-wpt --ohos` (runner from `wip-wpt-ohos` + device fixes on
  scratch branch `ohos-sync-2026-08-29-wpt`): 78 tests, 0 differing
  subtests, store proof both legs. `--flavor=harmonyos` does not install on
  the DAYU200 (profile UDID); default flavor, hap-sign-tool signing.
- found during validation: servoshell race `webdriver.rs:171 Expected at
  least one window to be open` when WebDriver answers before
  `on_surface_created`; `hdc file send -b` fails on the DAYU200 (hdc
  3.2.0b) — worked around in the runner, servoshell fix pending.
