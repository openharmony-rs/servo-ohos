"""HTTP cache index survives being backgrounded and killed.

A phone application is frozen and then killed rather than shut down, so the cache
index -- which is otherwise only written once changes stop -- would never reach
disk and every cold start would pay a directory scan. `ServoNWeb::OnPause` (which
ACE calls on window hide and app background) therefore flushes it synchronously.

This is the regression guard for that path, end to end on a device:

  1. start from an empty cache directory,
  2. load a cacheable page so the store has something to write down,
  3. send the app to the home screen and assert the index reaches disk,
  4. force-stop, i.e. the kill an OS reaper would do,
  5. restart and assert the index was *loaded*, not rebuilt by scanning.

Step 5 is the one that matters and the one a purely functional check would miss:
the cache still answers from disk either way, because a rebuild finds the same
entries. The two paths are told apart by the `http-cache: index ...` markers in
`components/net/http_cache/disk/index.rs`.
