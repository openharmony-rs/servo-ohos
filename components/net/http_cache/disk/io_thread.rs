//! One dedicated thread per disk store, doing all of its blocking I/O.
//!
//! A dedicated thread rather than `tokio::fs` because a cross-thread hand-off
//! costs 28 to 45 us on the OHOS devices, several times a 64 KiB read: with one
//! thread and one hand-off per *batch* of syscalls the cost is amortised, file
//! descriptors stay warm, and operations on one file keep their order. Doing the
//! I/O inline on a tokio worker is not an option either, since a cold 64 KiB read
//! on eMMC takes 375 us and writeback throttling can stall a write for
//! milliseconds.
